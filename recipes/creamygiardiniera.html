<h2>Description</h2>
<p>We can all but guarantee this four-ingredient dip will become a party staple in your house. For the right final consistency and rich flavor, use oil-based giardiniera (also called Chicago-style) rather than a vinegar-based variety, which allows the giardiniera to seamlessly blend into the silky cream cheese, sour cream, and Parmesan mixture.</p>
<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
    <li>8 oz. Cream Cheese, Room Temperature</li>
    <li>1 oz. Parmesan, Finely Grated (about 1/2 cup)</li>
    <li>1/2 Cup Sour Cream</li>
    <li>Kosher Salt</li>
    <li>Freshly Ground Pepper</li>
    <li>1 Cup Drained Coarsley Chopped Oil-Based Giardiniera, Plus More for Serving and Oil from the Jar for Drizzling</li>
    <li>Triscuits or Other Crackers (for serving)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Preparation</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Process 8 oz. cream cheese, room temperature, 1 oz. Parmesan, finely grated (about ½ cup), and ½ cup sour cream in a food processor until combined and smooth; season with kosher salt and freshly ground pepper. Add 1 cup drained coarsely chopped oil-based giardiniera and pulse until incorporated but dip is not completely smooth.</li>
